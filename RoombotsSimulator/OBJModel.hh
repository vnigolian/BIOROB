/**
	An OBJModel is a Model that gets its vertices from a .obj file.
	.obj (wavefront) files are standard graphics models files and are pretty easy to parse.
	But they also contain shading and texturing information that are not used in this software.
	Furthermore, .obj files sometimes contain polygons which would be ignored by the parser.
	However, quads would be interpreted as two triangles

	This class allows to use complex models pretty easily.
