/**This class makes the Rift much simpler to use.
  All that must be done is first initialise the Rift with 'Init(DisplayFunction)', where 'DisplayFunction'
  is the function that draws what we want to display on the Rift and then call 'DisplayOnRift' when we want 
  to display something on the Rift.
  To take its orientation into account when drawing the scene (in the DisplayFunction passed in argument in 'Init()'), 
  one must can use the 'ovrViewProjMatrix()' or 'glmViewProjMatrix()' methods to get the view-projection matrix 
  in the form of a OVR::Matrix4f or a glm::mat4 matrix.
  The OVR::Matrix4f is how it is created by the Rift's SDK but the glm::mat4 one is easier to use with OpenGL
